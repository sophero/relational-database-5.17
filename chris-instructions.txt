Create a blogs table and a users table. Blogs should be associated with a user.

Create a sign up and login form. If I sign up, it should automatically also log me in.

A signed-in user should be able to create blogs that are associated with that signed-in user.

 If I click the title of a blog post, it should take me to a page for just that blog post that was clicked.

Create a comments table that is associated with both users and blogs (as in, a blog belongs to a user and a blog).

 A user should be able to go to a blog’s page and comment on the blog post. All comments on a blog post should be shown underneath the blog with the author of the comment listed.
